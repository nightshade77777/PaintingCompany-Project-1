# PaintingCompany - Project-1

Caroline runs a painting and decorating company. The company specialises in indoor
painting. 

Customers can call, email, or visit her store to enquire about the cost of having
their rooms painted.

Caroline needs a system that can:
• hold employee information

• generate an estimate to show the cost of painting a customer’s rooms

• monitor any outstanding customer payments.


Features of the system
• The user interface must be text based.

• Caroline must be able to:
• enter employee information

• enter customer information

• enter the dimensions of each room

• generate an estimate.

• To generate an estimate the system needs to:
• calculate the surface area of the walls in square metres (height x width)

• add £15 per square metre for paint

• add £70 per room if wallpaper needs to be removed

• add on the employee charge:
• £250 for a fully-qualified painter
• £100 for an apprentice.

• Caroline must be able to:
• search for an estimate
• view outstanding payments
• view how much money has been paid to the company (revenue).
